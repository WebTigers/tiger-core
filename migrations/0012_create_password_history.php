/**
 * Migration 0012 — create `password_history` (retained old password hashes).
 *
 * WHY: `user_credential` holds only the CURRENT password hash (setPassword
 * overwrites on change). Reuse-prevention needs the OLD hashes, so we archive them
 * here on every change. Tiger_Policy_Password checks a candidate against the current
 * hash + the last N of these.
 *
 * Append-only history (NO mutable standard columns — a history row is never edited).
 * FK cascade: deleting a user removes their history. `secret` is VARBINARY like
 * user_credential.secret (a bcrypt hash; one-way, stored as-is). Pruned to the
 * policy's `history` count by Tiger_Model_PasswordHistory::prune so it can't grow
 * unbounded.
