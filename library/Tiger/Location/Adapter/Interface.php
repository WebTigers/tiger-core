 * Tiger_Location_Adapter_Interface — the capability contract every Location provider implements.

 * An adapter declares which of the four operations it can do via capabilities(); the
 * Tiger_Location facade only calls an operation on an adapter that supports it (else it
 * throws Tiger_Location_Exception). Every operation returns Tiger_Location_Place(s), so the
 * payload is identical regardless of provider (AWS Location Service, Nominatim/OSM, Google,
 * Mapbox, an IP-geolocation vendor, …). Extend Tiger_Location_Adapter_Abstract rather than
 * implementing this directly — it defaults every op to "unsupported" so you override only
 * what you actually provide.
